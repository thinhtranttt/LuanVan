OPEN MOUTH BLENDSHAPE


Models have Open Mouth blendshape, which can be used to control the mouth with script. It is under the Head geometry, Skinned Mesh rederer.

Models have also working jaw bone, incase you want to control the jaw with animation. It is disabled by default, you need to select it under Rig >  Configure > Head > Jaw
